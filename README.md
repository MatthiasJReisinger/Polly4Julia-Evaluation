# Polly4Julia-Evaluation

The goal that I have in mind for this repostitory is to provide a collection of benchmarks that evaluate the profitability of my Google Summer of Code project [Enabling Polyhedral Optimizations in Julia](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5mmSW965qmOEbHiM3O4XFz-Vd7cy9TxX9RQaTK_SQo/edit?usp=sharing). At the moment, however, it is a (more or less unstructured) "playground" were I gather code snippets that might be useful for experimental purposes.

## Benchmark Overview

| Benchmark         | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `gemm`            | General matrix multiplication                          |
| `qamm`            | Matrix multiplication restricted to quadratic matrices |
| `row_sum`         | Sum of rows in a matrix                                |
| `sum3d`           | Sum of elements in 3rd dimension of a 3d-matrix        |
