# PollyBenchmarks

The goal that I have in mind for this package is to provide a collection of benchmarks that evaluate the profitability of my Google Summer of Code project [Enabling Polyhedral Optimizations in Julia](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5mmSW965qmOEbHiM3O4XFz-Vd7cy9TxX9RQaTK_SQo/edit?usp=sharing). At the moment, however, it is a (more or less unstructured) "playground" where I gather code snippets that might be useful for experimental purposes.
